## Sage.js

> sage.js is a powerful javascript library to help you build an application based on the official Riotgames Valorant API.

---

### Installation

### Getting Started

_Before you start, please note that the valorant api can only be used with a production api key._

To start, you first have to import the library and init the ValorantAPI class of the api.

```javascript
const { ValorantAPI, Regions } = require("sage.js");

//init the ValorantAPI class for the region you can use all that are provided by the Regions object of the library
const api = new ValorantAPI("*your api key", Regions.NorthAmerica);
```

The ValorantAPI class provides functions for all the at [Riot Developer Portal (riotgames.com)](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis) listed valorant endpoints.

To call an endpoint you can just do:

```javascript
//returns a object of content that is used by the game
const data = await api.getContent();
```

To use the match endpoints you have to use the .match prefix:

```javascript
//returns the data of a match by the id
cost matchData = await api.match.getByID("*matchID*")
```

#### A list of all available functions for the ValorantAPI class:

<table><tbody><tr><td>.getContent()</td><td>Get content optionally filtered by locale</td></tr><tr><td>.match.getByID("*matchId*")</td><td>Get match by id</td></tr><tr><td>.match.getListbyPuuid("*puuid*")</td><td>Get matchlist for games played by puuid</td></tr><tr><td>.match.getbyQueueID("queueId")</td><td>Get recent matches</td></tr><tr><td>.getCompetitiveLeaderbord("*actId*")</td><td>Get leaderboard for the competitive queue</td></tr><tr><td>.getStatus()</td><td>Get VALORANT status for the given platform.</td></tr></tbody></table>
